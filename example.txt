Animals as Information-Processing Systems
After years of behaviorism as a dominant paradigm in the psychological sciences, the cognitive revolution reframed the way scientists approached the study of the mind. Along with new developments of information science in other technical fields came a new paradigm of psychology, cognitive science, in which animals were understood as information-processing systems. This information-processing model of animals emphasized the role of the brain in processing information from the outside world to learn and guide behavior. Thus, the subject of study largely turned from behavior to the fundamental information-manipulating processes that are employed by the brain. 
The essence of this information-processing model of the mind at the foundation of cognitive science can be better understood through David Marr’s explanation of levels of understanding. As Marr famously observed, this model of the mind opens questions on many levels of abstraction, from how the brain physically perceives and manages information, to what general, computational purposes different processes serve. In other words, this new understanding of animals as information-processing systems not only entailed learning about the physical medium of information processes in the brain. It also called for an exploration of the general processes employed by the mind at higher levels of abstraction.
	This information-processing model of the mind provides a stark contrast to the black-box model that behaviorism utilized before. While the model of cognitive science allows for a mind that internally processes information in order to learn and regulate behavior, behaviorism sought to explain behavior solely as the result of stimuli in the environment. The fundamental differences between these two paradigms have been illustrated in a multitude of experiments and observations, especially preceding the cognitive revolution. Perhaps one of the most significant experiments to test these two paradigms head to head is that conducted by Edward Tolman in 1930.
	With his experiment, Tolman sought to explore how rats learned to run through mazes. As behaviorists believed that all learning was association between stimuli and responses, behaviorists ascribed the maze-learning ability of rats to operant conditioning, a type of learning that associates certain behavior with reward or punishment. So, they hypothesized that rats associated certain stimuli throughout the maze, such as physical features of the walls, with actions that would ultimately take them to the reward. To test this hypothesis, Tolman assigned three groups of rats to different patterns of reinforcement as they ran the mazes. The first group was consistently rewarded for completing the maze, the second group was only rewarded for completion in the second half of the trials, and the third group was never rewarded. This experimental setup provided Tolman with an opportunity to test the behaviorist hypothesis that learning must be mediated through associated reward.
	Ultimately, the results of Tolman’s experiment provided strong evidence to reject this behaviorist model, and therefore garnered support for the information-processing model of cognitive science. At the end of the experiment, Tolman found that there was a significant difference between the learning rates of the first group of rats and the second group. Contrary to the behaviorist hypothesis, it was found that the rats in the second group actually learned to run through the maze much faster than the first once they were reward with food, implying that the rats had actually been learning while wandering the maze without reward. Unable to explain this new form of latent learning with the old rules of association, many turned to the inner workings of the mind for explanation. It was largely hypothesized that the rats had developed mental maps, or spatial models, to help them navigate the mazes. This shift in thinking about the mind subsequently called for a revolutionary change in how animals and their behavior were modelled. Thus, a large step was taken toward the information-processing tools of cognitive science to peer into the mind and explain this new phenomenon.
